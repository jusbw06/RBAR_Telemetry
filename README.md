# Red Bull Air Race Telemetry

This code is meant to be run on a Rasberry Pi aboard an airplane at very low altitudes or any other vehicle in range of a cell tower.

This system will boot the Raspberry Pi, connect to the nearest cell tower, receive serial data from an onboard sensor and transmit that data to a predetermined IP address (the ground station).

I built this system to solve my professor's issue of not being able to see his team's airplane's instrument data in real time.
